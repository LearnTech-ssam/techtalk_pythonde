  - [2024-10-16 England flu bed occupation 2023-24.csv](https://github.com/LearnTech-ssam/techtalk_pythonde/blob/main/data/2024-10-16%20England%20flu%20bed%20occupation%202023-24.csv) is a csv of the cleaned data, after data engineering processes.
 
- [images](https://github.com/LearnTech-ssam/techtalk_pythonde/tree/main/images) contains images shown in this repository.

- [Presentation - Tech Career Talks - Python Data Engineering Skills for Public Datasets.pdf](https://github.com/LearnTech-ssam/techtalk_pythonde/blob/main/Presentation%20-%20Tech%20Career%20Talks%20-%20Python%20Data%20Engineering%20Skills%20for%20Public%20Datasets.pdf) is a pdf version of the presentation that was given during the live Tech Career Talk.

- [README.md](https://github.com/LearnTech-ssam/techtalk_pythonde/blob/main/README.md) is the file you are currently reading.

- [Tech_Talk_Python_DE.html](https://github.com/LearnTech-ssam/techtalk_pythonde/blob/main/Tech_Talk_Python_DE.html) is a html version of the .ipynb file and is screen reader compatible.

- [Tech_Talk_Python_DE.ipynb](https://github.com/LearnTech-ssam/techtalk_pythonde/blob/main/Tech_Talk_Python_DE.ipynb) contains Python code to clean the raw data and save it as the cleaned csv. The file was created to be used in Kaggle Notebooks.

# How do I run the .ipynb file in Kaggle Notebooks?
1. Save the [.ipynb file](https://github.com/LearnTech-ssam/techtalk_pythonde/blob/main/Tech_Talk_Python_DE.ipynb)
2. Log into [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code)
3. Verify your account using your phone number by clicking on your profile icon -> Settings -> Phone verification
4. On the top left, click the + button then "New Notebook"
5. In the notebook, click "File" then "Import Notebook" then select the .ipynb file you saved earlier. The images will not show but the code will run.
